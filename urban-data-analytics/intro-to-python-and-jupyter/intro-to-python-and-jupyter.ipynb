    "## What is coding/programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding, or computer programming, is the act of giving a computer written instructions for a task or set of tasks. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), it \"involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages, just like *Python* and *R* and *JavaScript* can be thought of similarly to languages that people speak and write, like Spanish or Arabic -- each language has its own set of rules and different syntax, but (most) ideas can be translated from one language to another. Instead of using language to communicate with other people, you write code to give directions to a computer. In data analysis, these directions could be to summarize data in a table, create a chart or a map, or generate a statistical model, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why learn programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spreadsheet software, like [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel), [Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/), and [LibreOffice calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) can be great for viewing and exploring data, as well as quick analyses, they can be super limited for serious data analysis. They struggle with large datasets, lacks robust tools for cleaning and transforming complex data, have very limited options for spatial/geographic data, and makes reproducibility nearly impossible. Plus, it's easy to introduce silent errors with formulas or copy-pasting. For anything beyond basic summaries or charts, scripting languages like Python are far more powerful, reliable, and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you are not interested in learning Python, many of the other notebooks in this online textbook that show Python examples, include links to equivalent examples in QGIS or Excel).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why learn Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) is a widely used programming language, especially in urban and spatial analysis, because it's easy to learn relative to other languages and has a strong ecosystem of libraries for working with data, maps, and models. Plus, it's open source and has a huge community of people that use and develop it, which means lots of learning resources and support. While we'll mostly be looking at Python, the same concepts are applicable across many other languages and software."

    "## Download Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can run any Python code, download the most recent version of Python from [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already. Make sure to choose the correct version for your computer (Windows vs. macOS), and follow the instructions to complete the download.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of Python download website](img/python_download.png){width=50%}\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I run Python code using the terminal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lets you write instructions in a plain text file, often called a *script*, which the Python interpreter on your computer reads and runs line by line. You don’t need to \"compile\" your code like in some other languages—you can just write it, save it as a `.py` file, and run it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, create a file on your computer called `my-script.py`, a very simple script which simply prints \"Hello, world!\". You can do this by opening a basic text editor (e.g., TextEdit on macOS or Notepad on Windows), writing (only) the following code, and saving the file as `my-script.py` in a directory (folder) that you'll remember. It might make sense to create a new folder on your computer for the work you do in this workshop so that it's all in one place. Make sure to use that file extension instead of saving it as a `.txt` text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, run this code using the *command line* in your *terminal*. The terminal is an application that provides access to the command line, which is the space where you type instructions for your computer to execute. However, the terms \"command line\" and \"terminal\" are often used interchangeably, and are also called the shell, console, prompt, or various other names.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the terminal/command line to do things like run programs and manipulate files and folders stored on your computer. The command line has its own language and syntax, kind of like how Python is its own language, and some of the commands are slightly different for different operating systems. In other words, they might change depending on whether you have a Mac or a Windows computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open the terminal on a Mac, follow [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac). To open the terminal on a Windows computer, follow [these instructions](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows). [This link](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners) contains a more in-depth explanation of how the terminal works, and [this link](https://vteams.com/blog/how-to-run-a-python-script-in-terminal/) explains how to run a Python script in the terminal. If you're still having trouble, Google your questions (or use ChatGPT!) to troubleshoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "First navigate to the folder where you saved the `my-script.py` file using the `cd` command, which changes the directory. For example, if you saved the file in a folder called `urban-data`, type `cd urban-data` and hit enter. Make sure you're navigating to the folder according to the full filepath—this is important if it's not in your root folder. To see what files are located in this directory, use the `ls` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "See a list of Windows commands [here](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/1102-fall/Command%20Prompt%20Cheatsheet.pdf) and Mac commands [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complete-mac-terminal-commands-cheat-sheet/).\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "(base) your-computer-name ~ % cd urban-data \n",
    "(base) your-computer-name urban-data % ls\n",
    "my-script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Good—the `my-script.py` is in the `urban-data` folder. Once you're in the right folder, type the following: `python my-script.py`, and then hit enter. This should result in the computer printing out `Hello, world!` on the next line, like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "your-computer-name:~$ python my-script.py \n",
    "Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple example. Usually, you'll want your code to do more than just print out a statement. However, if you're running `.py` scripts in the terminal, it can be hard to see what your code is doing. For example, you won't be able to see a plot that you create in Python using just the command line. In the following section, we'll explain how you can use other tools and applications to code in a more interactive way."

    "\n",
    "When you write something in English or another language, you need to choose an environment to write in. For example, if you're writing an email, you might use Gmail or Outlook. If you're writing a report, you might use Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Or maybe you prefer writing on parchment with a quill pen!\n",
    "\n",
    "When coding, you also have to choose an environment to write in. This is typically called a \"code editor\" or *[integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)* (IDE). The simplest editor would simply be the `notepad` or `text editor` on your computer.  But there are many IDEs to choose from that make coding much easier.

If you write your code in a file that's saved with the `.py` file extension, you can run it all at once, and the computer will follow all of your instructions, one line at a time. This works well for scripts that are complete and do not need to be run in separate chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are exploring, analyzing, or visualizing data, it is sometimes easier to work in a *computational notebook*.

    "[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (named after Galileo's work!) are often used for data analysis in Python. When using a Jupyter Notebook, you can run code chunk-by-chunk and see the output right below each chunk.
