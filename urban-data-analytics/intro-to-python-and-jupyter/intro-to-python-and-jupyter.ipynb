    "## What is coding/programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers operate using code, which is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) as “a sequence or set of instructions in a programming language” that tells the computer what to do and how to do it. Coding, or [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), is the act of creating those written instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as you might imagine, computers and humans speak different languages. Computers operate using a specific type of code called machine code or machine language. You might recognize a basic form of machine code, binary notation, which is made up of 0s and 1s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since most people don’t speak fluent computer, we often rely on [high-level programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) like Python, R, and JavaScript to write our computer code. You can think of these programming languages as similar to languages that people speak and write, like Spanish or Arabic. Each language has its own set of rules and different syntax, but (most) ideas can be translated from one language to another. Instead of using language to communicate with other people, you write code to give directions to a computer. In data analysis, these directions could be to summarize data in a table, create a chart or a map, or generate a statistical model, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "With any (written) language, you also need to select a platform/interface/tool to write on—for example, a Word Document or a piece of paper. Each of these different tools has a slightly different interface and convention. In coding, these [tools are called environments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ni9muymVCDYcaGHT5AR2l_hlSm3plmyCI4JuvrapJhI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.weyvhko6wozt), which  we will discuss later in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why learn programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spreadsheet software, like [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel), [Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/), and [LibreOffice calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/), can be great for viewing and exploring data and performing simple analyses. However, they struggle with large datasets, lack robust tools for cleaning and transforming complex data, have very limited options for spatial/geographic data, and make reproducibility nearly impossible. Plus, it's easy to introduce silent errors with formulas or copy-pasting. For anything beyond basic summaries or charts, scripting languages like Python are far more powerful, reliable, and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not interested in learning Python, however, many of the other notebooks in this online textbook that show Python examples also include links to equivalent examples in QGIS or Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why learn Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) is a widely used programming language, especially in urban and spatial analysis, because it's easy to learn relative to other languages and has a strong ecosystem of libraries for working with data, maps, and models. Plus, it's open source and has a huge community of people that use and develop it, which means lots of learning resources and support. While we'll mostly be exploring Python, the same concepts are applicable across many other languages and software."

    "## Download Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can run any Python code, download the most recent version of Python from [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already. Make sure to choose the correct version for your computer (Windows vs. macOS), and follow the instructions to complete the download.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of Python download website](img/python_download.png){width=50%}\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck at any point while downloading software, using the terminal, or writing code, read [these tips](https://schoolofcities.github.io/urban-data-storytelling/urban-data-analytics/what-and-where-of-data/what-and-where-of-data.html#getting-help) for getting help.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I run Python code using the terminal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lets you write instructions in a plain text file, often called a *script*, which the Python interpreter on your computer reads and runs line by line. You don’t need to \"compile\" your code like in some other languages—you can just write it, save it as a `.py` file, and run it directly using the *command line* in your *terminal*. The terminal is an application that provides access to the command line, which is the space where you type instructions for your computer to execute. However, the terms \"command line\" and \"terminal\" are often used interchangeably, and are also called the shell, console, prompt, or various other names.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the terminal/command line to do things like run programs and manipulate files and folders stored on your computer. The command line has its own language and syntax, kind of like how Python is its own language, and some of the commands are slightly different for different operating systems. In other words, they might change depending on whether you have a Mac or a Windows computer. See a list of Windows commands [here](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/1102-fall/Command%20Prompt%20Cheatsheet.pdf) and Mac commands [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complete-mac-terminal-commands-cheat-sheet/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Write a `.py` script\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating a file on your computer called `my-script.py`, a very simple script which simply prints \"Hello, world!\". You can do this by (1) opening a basic text editor (e.g., TextEdit on macOS or Notepad on Windows), (2) writing (only) the following code... \n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...and (3) saving the file as `my-script.py` in a directory (another word for \"folder\") that you'll remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might make sense to create a new folder on your computer for the work you do in this workshop so that it's all in one place. Make sure to use that file extension instead of saving it as a `.txt` text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, make sure the full \"[file path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing))\"—the sequence of characters that specifies where on your computer a file is located—does not have any spaces or weird characters in it, as this can cause issues later on. For example, instead of creating a folder called `urban data`, create a folder called `urban-data` so that the full file path is `/Users/jpg23/urban-data/my-script.py` instead of `/Users/jpg23/urban data/my-script.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure how to get the file path of your `.py` script, see these helpful links for [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp1774/mac) and [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/670447/how-to-copy-the-full-path-of-a-file-on-windows-10/) computers. Note that the format of a file path might look different on different computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Open the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "To open the terminal on a Mac, follow [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac). To open the terminal on a Windows computer, follow [these instructions](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "[This link](https://vteams.com/blog/how-to-run-a-python-script-in-terminal/) explains how to run a Python script in the terminal. If you're still having trouble, Google your questions (or use ChatGPT!) to troubleshoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Navigate to the folder where you saved your `.py` file\n",
    "\n",
    "Now use the terminal to navigate to the folder where you saved the `my-script.py` file using the `cd` command, which changes the directory. For example, if you saved the file in a folder called `urban-data`, and the full file path to your `.py` file is `/Users/jpg23/urban-data/my-script.py` (to get the file path, see again these helpful links for [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp1774/mac) and [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/670447/how-to-copy-the-full-path-of-a-file-on-windows-10/)), you'd want to type `cd /Users/jpg23/urban-data` in the terminal and hit enter. This will bring you to the folder that your `.py` file is saved in.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of terminal `cd` command](img/terminal_cd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to see what files are located in this directory, use the `ls` command for Mac (or `dir` for Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of terminal `ls` command](img/terminal_ls.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Good—the `my-script.py` is indeed in the `urban-data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Run your script\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know you're in the right folder, type the following: `python my-script.py` and then hit enter. This should result in the computer printing out `Hello, world!` on the next line, like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of terminal command to run Python script](img/terminal_py.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're having trouble getting this output, first try typing `py my-script.py` or `python3 my-script.py` instead. If it's still not working, Google your questions or explain your problem to a chatbot like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and ask it to walk you through the steps. Chatbots are very good at solving these kinds of problems, but remember to always make sure you understand what they're telling you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code we just ran, despite all the steps it took, is very simple. Usually, you'll want your code to do more than just print out a statement. However, if you're running `.py` scripts in the terminal, it can be hard to see what your code is doing. For example, you won't be able to see a plot that you create in Python using just the command line.\n",

    "When you write something in English or another language, you need to choose an \"environment\" (i.e., platform/interface/application) to write in. For example, if you're writing an email, you might use Gmail or Outlook. If you're writing a report, you might use Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Or maybe you prefer writing on parchment with a quill pen!\n",

The simplest editor would simply be the `notepad` or `text editor` on your computer.  But there are many IDEs to choose from that make coding much easier. Some of the most popular ones for Python are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (\"VS Code\") and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).\n",

    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to execute code, or tell the computer to perform the instructions you've written. If you write your code in a file that's saved with the `.py` file extension, you can run it all at once, and the computer will follow all of your instructions, one line at a time. This works well for scripts that are complete and do not need to be run in separate chunks.\n",

    "If you are exploring, analyzing, or visualizing data, it is sometimes easier to work in a *computational notebook*. Computational notebooks are coding environments that not only allow you to write code, but also let you write explanations and show the outputs of your analysis, very similar to pre-digital formats.\n",

    "[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (named after Galileo's work!) are often used for data analysis in Python. When using a Jupyter Notebook, you can run code chunk-by-chunk and see the output right below each chunk. For example, you can write a chunk of code that manipulates a dataframe and then look at the first few rows of the dataframe right below the code.
