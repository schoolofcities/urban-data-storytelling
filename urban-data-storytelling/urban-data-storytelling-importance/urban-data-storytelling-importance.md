To tell a data story, start by understanding that cities are not just a collection of places but a web of interactions and interconnected systems. To build a coherent and compelling story, we must make a series of thoughtful decisions: how we observe our cities, what we choose to measure, how we analyze that information, and how we communicate our findings to others. This process lays the foundation for meaningful data storytelling that reflects the complexity of urban life.


## Elements of a good data story

Strong stories have a temporal or sequential structure that shows change over time. They explain not just what is, but what happened and what could be. Good stories are generalizable - they reveal something broader through specific examples. They follow conventions, with plots and protagonists, and often include a moral tension that invites resolution. When done well, data storytelling taps into shared values, which helps create buy-in.

Examples included in the video show how impactful good data storytelling can be:

- In Toronto, 3D visualizations of cell phone data captured shifts in downtown activity before, during, and after the pandemic, offering a clear story of disruption and gradual recovery. 

- After the wildfire in Paradise, California, a relocation map illustrated how most displaced families stayed close to home, reinforcing a universal need for safety and connection. 

- Emotional power can also come from how data is visualized: the firm Periscopic‚Äôs portrayal of gun deaths as ‚Äúyears of life lost‚Äù reframes statistics into a story about deeply human loss. 

- Interactive tools like the Urban Institute‚Äôs prenatal care equity model go even further, showing the difference between our status quo and a truly equitable future.

## Steps to building your urban data story 

To build an effective data story, it is important to always start with identifying your goals and your audience (Step A). From there, it is often an iterative process between crafting your specific narrative (Step B) and analyzing your data (Step C). You may go back-and-forth between these two general steps many times before finally bringing it all together into your final product or deliverable (Step D).

### A. Identify your goals

1. *Identify your project goals.* Thinking about your specific project, identify what you are aiming to achieve in the short term, medium term, long term in relation to your specific project. 

2. *Map your stakeholders and their positions.* Identify the people or organizations who have an interest in your work, or who you wish had a stake in your work. What are their interests, and how do these interests relate to your project goals? How involved (or uninvolved) are each of these parties? What is your timeline for involving/engaging them? 

3. *Prioritize an audience for your story.* From your list of stakeholders, identify which specific audience you want to engage with for this story, and why. 

### B. Craft your data story

4. *Identify the type of story that is right for your goals.* Figure out what you need to do to get yourself, your organization, and your stakeholders from where you are now to the goal post that you set for yourself. Do you need to tell a descriptive story, a persuasive story, x story, or y story?

5. *Build a story outline that creates shared ground with your audience.* Consider how to build a story that creates shared ground with your audience, and that reflects and taps into your audience‚Äôs interests. What findings and metrics would connect to or speak to their values or tap into their interests? How can you look for opportunities or assets, and offer up forward-looking solutions?

6. *Brainstorm your key metrics.* Without being overly concerned just yet with data access and availability, brainstorm the key metrics that would be best suited to tell your story. These could be metrics that validate your success, highlight a need or issue to address, demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention, etc.

7. *Draft an actionable takeaway for your audience.* Think about the final messaging or call to action you want to leave with your audience. What is your main takeaway and what specific action(s) do you want your audience to take? 

### C. Work on your data

8. *Select and narrow down your data sources.* Now that you have drafted a story arc and brainstormed key metrics, it is time to investigate and take stock of the data resources that are available to you now. Explore what datasets and variables are available from publicly available sources, third party proprietary data, or any other internal data you or your stakeholders might have access to. Narrow down a short list of accessible datasets and/or variables which you will use for your analysis and visualization. 

9. *Understand ethical issues related to your data.* Before proceeding with data processing and analysis, take the time to understand your datasets. How was this data collected, by whom, when, and why? Are there any confidentiality concerns? Are there any biases or limitations you should be aware of with this dataset?

10. *Query, process, and analyze your data.* Now is the time to dig into your dataset to understand and uncover trends, patterns, and findings for your story. Using spreadsheet software, geographic information system (GIS) software, and/or coding, start cleaning, querying, and processing your data. Explore your data by creating basic summary statistics, pivot tables, maps, etc. Identify the key findings from your data.

11. *Create data visualizations.* Now that you have analyzed your data and decided what findings you want to highlight, create your data visualizations (charts and/or maps) and apply the principles of effective data visualization (uncluttered visuals, cohesive colors and fonts, etc.) 

    - Create non-spatial data visualizations 

    - Create spatial data visualizations 

    - Apply principles of effective data visualization (aesthetics, graphic design)

### D. Bring it all together

12. *Wrap up your final deliverable.* Discuss and iterate your data insights with your team and partners. Integrate your data visualizations within your narrative to bring together your final story. Finalize your story in the form of the final deliverable of your choosing - this could be a story map, webpage, slide deck, report, etc. 

13. *Communicate using your final deliverable.* Circling back to steps 1-12, implement tips for effective visual deliverables (e.g. reduce visual clutter, minimize words on slides, etc.) and, if applicable, apply tips for effective verbal presentations (e.g. tone, voice, etc.)
