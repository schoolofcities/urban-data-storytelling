    "Coding, or computer programming, is the act of giving a computer written instructions for a task or set of tasks. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), it \"involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages, just like *Python* and *R* and *JavaScript* can be thought of similarly to languages that people speak and write, like Spanish or Arabic -- each language has its own set of rules and different syntax, but (most) ideas can be translated from one language to another. Instead of using language to communicate with other people, you write code to give directions to a computer. In data analysis, these directions could be to summarize data in a table, create a chart or a map, or generate a statistical model, for example. \n",

    "Spreadsheet software, like [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel), [Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/), and [LibreOffice calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) can be great for viewing and exploring data, as well as quick analyses, they can be super limited for serious data analysis. They struggle with large datasets, lacks robust tools for cleaning and transforming complex data, have very limited options for spatial/geographic data, and makes reproducibility nearly impossible. Plus, it's easy to introduce silent errors with formulas or copy-pasting. For anything beyond basic summaries or charts, scripting languages like Python are far more powerful, reliable, and scalable.\n",

    "[Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) is a widely used programming language, especially in urban and spatial analysis because it's easy to learn relative to other languages and has a strong ecosystem of libraries for working with data, maps, and models. Plus, it's open source and has a huge community, which means lots of learning resources and support.\n",
