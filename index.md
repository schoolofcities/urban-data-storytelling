Welcome to the Urban Data Storytelling online textbook, written and created by the School of Cities at the University of Toronto. 

Urban data storytelling is the process and practice of using data to craft compelling narratives about cities, in order to communicate key insights, inform policy-making, build public will, or advocate for change. 

Urban data storytelling combines data analysis, data visualization, and narrative techniques to make complex urban trends understandable and engaging for specific audiences, such as policymakers, funders, or community members.

This online textbook will walk you through three core modules that will help you build and round out your urban data storytelling skills, including:

- The importance of urban data storytelling  
- Urban data analysis
- Urban data visualization
