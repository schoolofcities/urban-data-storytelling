---

Welcome to the Urban Data Storytelling online textbook, written and created by the [School of Cities](https://schoolofcities.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. 

Urban data storytelling is the process and practice of using data to craft compelling narratives about cities, in order to communicate key insights, inform policy-making, build public will, or advocate for change. 

Urban data storytelling combines data analytics, data visualization, and narrative techniques to make complex urban trends understandable and engaging for specific audiences, such as policymakers, funders, or community members.

This online textbook has three core modules, each composed of one or more notebooks or tutorials.

- The importance of urban data storytelling  
- Urban data analysis
- Urban data visualization
