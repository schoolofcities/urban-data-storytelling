*Data visualization (V4, V5)*

Assessment:
- Create at least 3 maps and/or charts of your data that help communicate patterns and help tell your story. Try to make at least 1 non-spatial chart and at least 1 map/spatial data visualization.

Mandatory readings:
- data visualization (notebook)
- maps and spatial data visualization (notebook)
Optional readings (pick and choose depending on which relate to your project):

Thank y'all for all your edits, additions, etc. huge improvement overall!:)

I've integrated almost everything for the first two sections (storytelling and analytics) between meetings today. Didn't have time to do the visualization part, will do that Monday morning (so far I only have 3hours of meetings on Monday)

I've also tried to fix consistency issues throughout (terms should all be italic/yellow, prompts and buttons to click blue/bold), as well as little copyediting/language consistency that is inevitable when this many people are working on something

Remaining to dos for the storytelling and analytics:
- Integrate the two tables (all can add to the Google Sheet, I can copy over on Monday)
- In the ethics notebook, please format the additional readings section to .md link format [text](URL) and a consistent citation/naming style (Michelle? Evelyne?)
- For the new pages (data storytelling, ethics etc.), please send me .png or .jpg files of all images included (Michelle / Evelyne)
- Python intro notebook: More step-by-step intro to python for running a very simple script (Julia)
- Python intro notebook: Create glossery table for common terms (Julia)
- Python intro notebook: have examples urban rather than names and fruit (Julia)

- stats page - list other examples of hypoth tests?
